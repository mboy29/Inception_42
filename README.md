For this project you will have to set up a mini-infrastructure with different services.

More specifically, you will have to set up:
- A Docker container containing NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only;
- A Docker container containing WordPress + PHP-fpm (installed and configured) only without NGINX;
- A Docker container containing MariaDB only without NGINX;
- A volume containing your WordPress database;
- A second volume containing your WordPress site files;
- A docker-network that will link your containers.

Beware, this project will have to be carried out in a virtual machine.

Good luck!
